# Hostinger Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your project is ready for deployment!

### Files to upload to Hostinger:
Upload the **entire contents** of the `dist` folder to your Hostinger hosting account:

```
dist/
├── .htaccess          # Server configuration for SPA routing
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── assets/            # CSS and JS files
│   ├── index-ac28e7d0.css
│   └── index-5e121d82.js
└── llms.txt          # Generated file
```

### Upload Instructions:

1. **Access your Hostinger File Manager** or use FTP
2. **Navigate to your domain's public_html folder** (or www folder)
3. **Upload all files from the dist folder** to the root of public_html
4. **Ensure index.html is in the root directory**

### What's been optimized:

✅ **Build completed successfully** - All dependencies installed and built
✅ **Production files generated** - Optimized CSS and JS bundles
✅ **SPA routing configured** - .htaccess file added for proper React Router support
✅ **SEO optimized** - Proper title and meta description added
✅ **Performance optimized** - Compression and caching headers configured
✅ **Security headers** - Basic security headers added

### Testing:
- Your site should now work properly on Hostinger
- All routes should work correctly (no 404 errors on refresh)
- Images and assets should load properly

### If you need to make changes:
1. Edit files in the `src` folder
2. Run `pnpm run build` to rebuild
3. Upload the new `dist` contents to Hostinger
